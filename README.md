You are reading the ```

``` file in the ETL_6 repository for Russ Robbins. This repository shows files related to parsing a specific file which explains how to read a specific data file generated by the IHIS system at https://www.ihis.us .

# Inputs to Step 6

 - `ihis_household_1997_2014.cbk` (in the `input_data folder`)

# Processing in Step 6

- a person can run `read_codebook.py` after changing the value of the `codebook_FILE` variable on line 16.

# Outputs of Step 6

 - a file which indicates the data file columns that have values restricted to certain values.
 	- ` CODE_DEFINITIONS.csv`
 - a set of files that indicate definitions for each of the values for a code.
 	- Files beginning with `CODE_VALUES_`
 - a file that indicates the years of NHIS data that were sampled in order to create the `*.dat` file.
  -  `SAMPLE_NAMES_AND_TYPES.csv`
 - a file that indicates which codes are represented in which years.
  -  `CODED_DATA_BY_SAMPLE_INFO.csv`
 - a file that helps a person read `CODED_DATA_BY_SAMPLE_KEY.csv`.
 	- `CODED_DATA_BY_SAMPLE_KEY.csv`
